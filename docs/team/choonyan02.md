### Project: Npc_Track

Npc_Track is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Npc_Track can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- Test Coverage
  - Covered Attendance and Participation classes.

- New Features
  - Attendance
    - What it does:
      - Allows TA to mark or unmark a students attendance for a particular tutorial session.
      - This feature helps the TA to manage their students attendance record.
  - Participation
    - What it does:
      - Allows TA to input a students participation points for a particular tutorial session.
      - This feature addresses the need for a more detailed and granular view of students' participation and
      engagement in tutorials. It complements the existing attendance management system, 
      making it a more comprehensive tool for educators and administrators.
